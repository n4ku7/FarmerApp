## Getting Started

### Quick Start
This is a static site that can be opened directly in a browser or served locally for better performance.

**Option A: Direct Access**
```bash
# Simply open index.html in your browser
open index.html  # macOS/Linux
start index.html # Windows
```

**Option B: Local Server (Recommended)**
```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000

# Node.js
npx http-server -p 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000

# PHP
php -S localhost:8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000
```

**Windows Example:**
```bat
cd "D:\HTML Projects\Farmer"
python -m http.server 8000
```

### First-Time Setup
1. Clone or download the project
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Start a local server (recommended)
4. Open your browser to the local server URL
5. Explore the unified login/register system
6. Test the dark/light theme toggle

## Theme System

### Dark/Light Mode
The platform features a sophisticated theme system with smooth transitions:

- **Automatic Detection**: Remembers user preference via localStorage
- **Smooth Transitions**: 0.3s cubic-bezier animations between themes
- **Icon Animation**: Theme toggle button rotates 360¬∞ when switching
- **Cross-page Persistence**: Theme choice maintained across all pages
- **Visual Feedback**: Notification appears when switching themes

### Theme Toggle Usage
```javascript
// Theme is automatically initialized
// Users can click the theme toggle button in the navbar
// Theme preference is saved and restored on page reload
```

### Customization
Themes can be customized by modifying CSS custom properties in `assets/css/theme.css`:
```css
/* Dark theme colors */
--bg-canvas: #0d1117;
--bg-subtle: #161b22;
--fg-default: #f0f6fc;

/* Light theme colors */
[data-bs-theme="light"] {
  --bg-canvas: #ffffff;
  --bg-subtle: #f8f9fa;
  --fg-default: #212529;
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Lazy Loading
Images are loaded only when they enter the viewport:
```javascript
// Images with data-src attribute are lazy loaded
<img data-src="image.jpg" class="loading">
```

### Service Worker Caching
Static assets are cached for offline functionality:
```javascript
// Service worker caches CSS, JS, and other static assets
// Improves loading speed on repeat visits
```

### Search Optimization
Debounced search prevents excessive API calls:
```javascript
// Search input has 300ms delay
// Reduces server load and improves UX
```

### Memory Management
Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks:
```javascript
// Event listeners are removed on page unload
// Intersection observers are disconnected when not needed
```

## Development Guidelines

### File Organization
- **Dashboard pages**: Place within appropriate dashboard folder (Farmer-Dashboard, Buyer-Dashboard, Admin-Dashboard)
- **Shared styles**: All common styles in `assets/css/theme.css`
- **Shared scripts**: Core functionality in `assets/js/main.js`
- **Performance scripts**: Optimization code in `assets/js/performance.js`
- **Images/icons**: Store in `assets/img/` directory
- **Service worker**: Root-level `sw.js` for caching

### Theme Development
- Use CSS custom properties for colors and spacing
- Test both dark and light themes when adding new components
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Use the theme toggle during development to verify consistency

### Performance Considerations
- Use `data-src` attribute for lazy-loaded images
- Implement debouncing for search and form inputs
- Add loading states for better user feedback
- Test with service worker enabled/disabled

### Linking & Navigation
- Use correct relative paths between sections
- Maintain consistent navigation across all dashboards
- Include theme toggle button in all page navbars
- Ensure all links work in both light and dark themes

### Browser Support
- **Modern browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Features**: ES6+, CSS Grid, Flexbox, Intersection Observer
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Conventions

### Naming
- **Files/folders**: kebab-case (`view-orders.html`, `product-management/`)
- **CSS classes**: BEM-like methodology (`.card`, `.card__header`, `.card--featured`)
- **JavaScript**: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for constructors

### HTML Standards
- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`)
- Minimize inline styles and scripts
- Include proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- Use `data-*` attributes for JavaScript functionality

### CSS Guidelines
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Include smooth transitions for interactive elements
- Test with both dark and light themes

### JavaScript Best Practices
- Modular code organization in `assets/js/main.js`
- Use modern ES6+ features
- Implement proper error handling
- Clean up event listeners and observers
- Use utility functions for common operations

### Code Quality
- Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic
- Validate HTML and test CSS
